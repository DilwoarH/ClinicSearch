# Clinics Search
```
Microservice using Clinics Data from data.gov.uk.
```

## Experimental Branches
### Caching
```
Branch Name: "caching" - https://github.com/DilwoarH/ClinicSearch/tree/caching
  - Adds caching to the microservice to allow quicker responses and more efficient responses by not relying on 
  3rd party systems for response times.
  - It also means that if there are restrictions in the Data API from data.gov.uk where a specific number of 
  requests can be made per seconds, it does not hit this limit.
```

## References

### Data API
```
https://data.gov.uk/data/api/service/health/clinics?city={city} - where {city} is city name, ie. London.
```

### Libraries Used
```
Express
- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features 
for web and mobile applications.

Lodash
- Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
- Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:
    - Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
    - Manipulating & testing values
    - Creating composite functions

Request / Request Promise Native
- Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. 
It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

Node-Cache
- A simple caching module that has set, get and delete methods and works a little bit like memcached.
